This is small Playframework Java project with dropwizard metrics attached to it.
=================================

This is skeleton playframework application which can be used for new project - it has dropwizard metrics instrumentation added on top of it.

This can be used as new application after removal of following code:
* Global.onStart sets RandomProvider this is not needed.
* RandomProvider and Impl are not needed
* Integration tests which tests the metrics are not needed and can be replaced with proper application code.

TODO
* Reporting
* Instrumentation of the clients
* HTTP statuses Instrumentation? is this required?

Open for suggestions and comments.
